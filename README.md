# 📖 Theory of Adaptive Resonance Learning Laws (ARLLs)

---

## 🔹 1. Abstract

Learning in neural systems and machine learning models can be expressed as **learning laws** — differential or difference equations that govern parameter change over time.
Conventional optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW) implement **error-driven learning laws**: parameters follow smoothed gradients of a loss.

**Adaptive Resonance Learning Laws (ARLLs)** extend this by coupling **error-driven updates** with **resonance-driven memory dynamics**. These laws introduce *prototypes* as explicit attractors in representation space and use *vigilance gating* to balance stability and plasticity.

ARLLs unify gradient descent and prototype resonance into a single dynamical framework, producing optimizers that are not only adaptive but also structurally stable against forgetting.

## 🔹 2. Core Principles

1. **Error-driven learning**:
   Parameters descend loss gradients (plasticity).

2. **Resonance-driven learning**:
   Hidden states and prototypes evolve toward stable resonant attractors (stability).

3. **Vigilance mechanism**:
   Gating law decides whether to update existing memory or allocate new prototypes (plasticity without overwriting).

4. **Coupled dynamics**:
   Optimization = gradient law + resonance law, both running in discrete-time, bounded-gain recursions.

## 🔹 3. Mathematical Formulation

### 3.1 Error-driven path

For parameters $\theta_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$:

$$
m_t = \mu m_{t-1} + (1-\mu) g_t, \quad g_t = \nabla_\theta \hat L_t(\theta_t)
$$

$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha m_t + \sigma_t D(\theta_t)\eta_t
$$

* $m_t$: filtered gradients (momentum IIR).
* $\alpha$: learning rate (adaptive).
* $\sigma_t D(\theta_t)\eta_t$: controlled dither (exploration).

### 3.2 Resonance-driven path

For hidden embedding $h_t \in \mathbb{R}^p$ and prototypes $w_j \in \mathbb{R}^p$:

**Resonance law** (hidden pulled to prototype):

$$
h_{t+1} = h_t + \lambda (w_j - h_t)
$$

**Prototype law** (discretized ART ODE):

$$
w_j \gets w_j + \eta \big((h_t \land w_j) - w_j\big)
$$

**Vigilance condition**:

$$
M_j(h_t,w_j) = \frac{|h_t \land w_j|}{|h_t|} \geq \rho
$$

* If true: update prototype $w_j$.
* If false: spawn new prototype $w_{\text{new}}$.

---

### 3.3 Coupling (learning laws combined)

Two canonical couplings:

* **Regularizer coupling**:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_{\text{ART}} \|h_t - w_j\|^2
$$

* **Feedback correction coupling**:

$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha m_t + \beta (h_{t+1} - h_t)
$$

Thus, the optimizer itself becomes a **dual dynamical system**: error descent + resonance stabilization.

## 🔹 4. DSP / Control Interpretation

* **Error-driven law** = 1st-order IIR filter on gradients (SGD, Adam).
* **Resonance law** = additional pole pulling states to prototypes.
* **Together** = 2nd-order resonant system (mass–spring–damper analogy).
* **Vigilance** = nonlinear switching law (update vs allocate).

In control terms:

* Gradient descent = damping force.
* Resonance = restoring spring toward attractor.
* Dither = bounded excitation for exploration.
* Scheduler = adaptive gain envelope.

---

## 🔹 5. Stability–Plasticity Balance

* **Stability**: Prototypes act as anchors in representation space.
* **Plasticity**: Vigilance ensures new prototypes are formed for novel inputs.
* **Optimization implication**:

  * Reduces catastrophic forgetting in continual learning.
  * Maintains long-term attractors while still adapting.

---

## 🔹 6. Design Heuristics

* **Learning rate bounds**: $\alpha_{\min}, \alpha_{\max}$.
* **Momentum**: $0 \leq \mu < 1$.
* **Prototype LR**: $\eta \ll 1$.
* **Vigilance**: $\rho \in [0.7, 0.9]$.
* **Resonance weight**: $\lambda_{\text{ART}} \ll 1$ for regression tasks.
* **Lyapunov heuristic**: enforce $\mathbb{E}[\ell_{t+1}-\ell_t|x_t]<0$.

---

## 🔹 7. Big Picture

* **SGD/Adam/AdamW**:
  Memoryless (except buffers). Optimize loss by smoothing noisy gradients.

* **ARLL Optimizers**:
  Extend learning law with resonance attractors + vigilance.
  Optimization becomes a **closed-loop control system with memory**.

👉 This turns “an optimizer” into a **learning law with stability–plasticity balance**, not just a gradient smoother.

# ✅ Thesis

> **Adaptive Resonance Learning Laws** reframe optimization as the coupling of error-driven descent and resonance-driven memory.
> The result is a 2nd-order, bounded-gain dynamical system where prototypes stabilize representations, vigilance gates novelty, and the optimizer itself embodies the stability–plasticity balance required for continual learning.
